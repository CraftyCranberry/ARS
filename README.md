# Reinforcemnet Learning, DQN vs QL
This repo contains code for my Reinforcement Learning Coursework for the Autonomous Robotics Module
I've cleaned up the repo and only kept the final code and reports. Feel free to go through the commit history to check the previous versions. 

## What is this about?
My research involved comparing how DQN and QL perform on simple environments from gymnasium. I compared various metrics to draw a rough conclusion. Please see report 2 for a full in-depth analysis.
